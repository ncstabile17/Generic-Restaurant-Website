This is the project repo for the Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools offered by Hong Kong University through Coursera.

This course provided an overview of client-side web frameworks, in particular Bootstrap. I learned about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. I learned about CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass as well as the basics of Node.js, NPM, and Web tools like Bower.<br><br>
Through this course I gained a better understanding of the Bootstrap framework and how to use Javascript, HTML, and CSS effectively within the framework. I was able to build the client-side of a full website from start to finish. <br><br>
